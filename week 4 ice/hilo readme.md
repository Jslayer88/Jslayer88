Are you willing to risk it all? The rules are simple. The player draws a new card. You guess if the next one will be higher or lower. Earn 100 points if you're right. Lose 75 if you're wrong. You can end the game at any time or just keep playing. Be careful though lose all your points and the game is ended for you!
