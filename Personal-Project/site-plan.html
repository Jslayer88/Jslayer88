      <h3>FAQS</h3>
      
      <h3>WHEN WILL WE RECEIVE OUR IMAGES?</h3>
      <p>
        I ask for up to 12 weeks to deliver a full wedding gallery. 
        For any type of portrait session, I ask for up to 2 weeks. 
        I am known for a quick turnaround time, so I like to get your 
        photos back to you ASAP. Need your photos done in a specific amount of time? 
        No problem. I now offer "rush fees" so you can get your photos right away.
      </p>
      
      <h3>WHAT TYPES OF SESSIONS DO YOU OFFER?</h3>
      <p>There is not a single thing that I don't photograph. 
        I do families, events, sports, newborns, engagements, weddings, portrait sessions, 
        rainbow bridge sessions, and lifestyle work. If you can think of it, 
        I most likely take photos of it. I love growing with my clients and becoming their forever photographer. 
      </p>

      <h3>HOW LONG DO YOU STORE FILES FOR?</h3>
      <p>I try to store files indefinitely, but do not guarantee the storage of images once the final gallery is delivered. 
        I have multiple hard drives and multiple backups. I do ask that when you download your gallery, you back up your files
        on the off chance something happens to mine. Once the final gallery is delivered and you have downloaded it, 
        I remove it from my site. If you need to get back into it at any time, that is not a problem at all. I can get you back into your gallery for $60. </p>
      
        <h3>WILL YOU WORK WITH MY BUDGET?</h3>
        <p>I wish that we could work with every budget! I understand that not everyone can afford the luxury of photographs.
         From time to time, I will try to work within a set budget if I have the date available. If you have a special circumstance like this, 
         please message me so we can chat more! Normally I am more flexible to this on Monday - Thursday mornings, and December - February weddings. 
         Unfortunately this does not apply to weekends.</p>
