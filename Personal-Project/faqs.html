        <DT class ="question">My approach-Am I right for you?

        <DD class ="answer">My style is really a hybrid. I have so many inspirations that come from many different places and I try to implement them in my images.
            I love the raw, real emotion of photojournalism, and at the same time desire to make you look cover-of-Vogue amazing. In short, my style is something I 
            like to call “directed photojournalism”. I believe in beautiful natural lighting, incredible backgrounds and choosing locations very carefully. 
            As far as my photojournalistic side - I never interrupt a moment. I never pose situations that are already so magical on their own. 
            I am an observer most of the time with very limited intrusion only when it is desired to achieve an artistic vision. Ninety percent of my images are 
            completely natural and un-posed. Any posed photos (beyond family photos) are simple “directed” natural moments.


        <DT class ="question">When wiLL I receive our images?
        <DD class ="answer"> I ask for up to 12 weeks to deliver a full wedding gallery. 
            For any type of portrait session, I ask for up to 2 weeks. 
            I am known for a quick turnaround time, so I like to get your 
            photos back to you ASAP. Need your photos done in a specific amount of time? 
            No problem. I now offer "rush fees" so you can get your photos right away.
            
        <DT class ="question">What type of sessions do you offer?
        <DD class ="answer">There is not a single thing that I don't photograph. 
            I do families, events, sports, newborns, engagements, weddings, portrait sessions, 
            rainbow bridge sessions, and lifestyle work. If you can think of it, 
            I most likely take photos of it. I love growing with my clients and becoming their forever photographer. 

        <DT class ="question">How long do you store the files for?
        <DD class ="answer">I try to store files indefinitely, but do not guarantee the storage of images once the final gallery is delivered. 
            I have multiple hard drives and multiple backups. I do ask that when you download your gallery, you back up your files
            on the off chance something happens to mine. Once the final gallery is delivered and you have downloaded it, 
            I remove it from my site. If you need to get back into it at any time, that is not a problem at all. I can get you back into your gallery for $60. 
          

        <DT class ="question">Will you work with my budget?
        <DD class ="answer">I wish that we could work with every budget! I understand that not everyone can afford the luxury of photographs.
            From time to time, I will try to work within a set budget if I have the date available. If you have a special circumstance like this, 
            please message me so we can chat more! Normally I am more flexible to this on Monday - Thursday mornings, and December - February weddings. 
            Unfortunately this does not apply to weekends.
                    
        <DT class ="question">Do you do destination weddings?
        <DD class ="answer">Live for them. Love them. Adore them. Can't wait to be a part of yours!! All that to say, yes, yes, I do. 
            I have always loved to travel. I've been very fortunate to see many corners of our world and it's even more delightful when I can add 
            capturing people's most special occasions. Destination wedding photography is a favorite of mine, give me a call an we can talk about details!

        <DT class ="question">How many hours do you suggest for a wedding?
        <DD class ="answer">This all depends on the details of your wedding and this would be a great topic to chat about over the phone to make sure you get the coverage 
            that is best for your dreams and plans for your big day. However, as a general rule, if you are having a wedding size around 100-150+ guests, 
            wedding party 3-6 people on each side, and have several family members I would recommend 8 hours of coverage. With 8 hours you can feel comfortable and confident 
            in knowing that all your moments and list of shots are getting covered, without feeling rushed or worried that you might not get it all in. Which of course is the 
            last thing you want to feel on your wedding day. You want to enjoy, relax, and leave stress at the door. If you are looking at a tighter budget, 5 hours of coverage 
            would be great for covering the shots of the bride and groom, wedding party, family and ceremony with just a bit of time left over for the reception.
